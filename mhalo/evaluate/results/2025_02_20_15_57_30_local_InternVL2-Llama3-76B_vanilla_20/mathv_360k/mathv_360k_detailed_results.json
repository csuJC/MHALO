Observing the bar heights:\n   - The bar height for Blue Violet is approximately 6 on the y-axis.\n   - The bar height for Violet Red is approximately 12 on the y-axis.\n3. Comparing the two values:\n   - 12 (Violet Red) is greater than 6 (Blue Violet).\n4. Therefore, Violet Red is greater than Blue Violet.\n\nThe correct answer is **B**.",
